## About MyToken

- **Name:** MyToken  
- **Symbol:** MTK  
- **Decimals:** 18  
- **Initial Supply:** Configurable at deployment (e.g., 1,000,000 tokens)  

This contract uses OpenZeppelin’s audited ERC-20 implementation for security and reliability.

## Deployment

- Deployed to Sepolia testnet  
- [Sepolia Etherscan link](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE) *(replace with your deployed contract address)*

## How to Add MyToken to MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask and switch to the **Sepolia testnet**.  
2. Scroll down and click **Import tokens**.  
3. Paste the contract address: 0x7574149f40409A8381E94B31b0693610Fb579E9c
4. The token symbol (`MTK`) and decimals (`18`) should auto-fill.  
5. Click **Add Custom Token** to finish.

## How to Use

- After deployment, the deployer address receives the initial supply of tokens.  
- You can transfer tokens to other addresses using any ERC-20 compatible wallet or interface.
